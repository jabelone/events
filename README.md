A place to store details about (most) events like hackathons/startup weekends I've made stuff at.  Visit my website [jaimyn.com.au](https://jaimyn.com.au "Visit my website") to see my blog and other projects.  Please note that most of these "live demos" aren't 100% functional as they are mostly just used to demonstrate a concept during a pitch.

# Events & Things

## Angel Hack Brisbane 2017 - "Eat It"
### Twitter Pitch
A platform to allow instant distribution of leftover food from events
### Description
"Eat It" is a platform to allow instant distribution of leftover food from events to people who are nearby.  You can think of it as Uber for leftover food and people in need like the homeless.  [Click Here](https://blog.me4502.com/EatIt/) to view the live demo that was pitched.  It pushes data to Dynamo DB via an AWS Lambda Function and API Gateway.  The static files can be hosted on S3 which means it can be quickly scaled with little work.
#### Prizes
The Runner Up/Mentoring prize by [Blue Chilli](https://www.bluechilli.com)

## Unearthed Hackathon Brisbane 2017 - Team "Under Pressure"
### Twitter Pitch
An API as a Service (AaaS) that provides a realtime down well pressure estimation based on above ground data.
### Description
We used a machine learning algorithm that accurately estimated the down well pressure at the bottom of a coal seam gas well.  This technology if implemented, was calculated to save Origin Energy about 1 Billion dollars over the next 10 years.  Unfortuneately the live demo requires a bit of maintenance and is no longer online.  Being an AaaS allows Origin to essentialy do what they want with the data, meaning it's easier to integrate into their systems.
#### Prizes
People's Choice Award (a free chrome cast for each team member)

## Flight Centre Hackathon Brisbane 2017 - "Travel Boards"
### Twitter Pitch
An integrated "experience" knowledgebase to customise and sell experiences instead of destinations/activities.
### Description
Flight Centre had a very under utilised resource, their staff.  We created a "experience" knowledge base to help staff customise packages and tailor them so the clients know exactly what sort of experiences they are getting.

## TADHack Global (Brisbane) 2016 - "Bus Bot"
### Twitter Pitch
A chatbot that allows you to quickly find the next departing bus.
### Description
The translink mobile App (and website) are terrible.  They have a bad UI, UX and is painfully slow to use.  Most people when they use the app/website just want to find out when the next bus is leaving.  Bus bot does one thing and it does it well.  Simply ask it a question like "when is the next 199 bus leaving queen st" to get an answer in a few seconds.  It used the Cisco Spark messaging platform and scraped real time data from the translink website.  [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERK3_2gNNqA) to view the full pitch and live demo.
#### Prizes
Both the TADHack Global Brisbane Grand Prize and the Best use of a Cisco API award
